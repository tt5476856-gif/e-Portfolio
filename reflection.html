        <h2>WHAT — Project Experience</h2>
        <p>The Secure Web Application project involved designing, implementing, and testing a web platform with strong authentication and encryption. The team comprised five members with varying experience levels. My primary role included implementing user authentication, threat modelling, and coordinating security testing. Critical incidents included an OWASP ZAP report revealing XSS vulnerabilities, which required rapid remediation and team communication.</p>
        <p>Key learning moments included understanding the significance of risk registers, properly applying AES encryption, and using JWT tokens for secure session management. Documentation and communication proved essential for effective collaboration, especially during code review and incident simulation exercises. This section consolidates the experiences and outcomes across all module units.</p>

        <h2>SO WHAT — Analysis & Learning</h2>
        <p>Throughout the project, I critically analysed my decision-making and behaviour. Early in the project, I underestimated the complexity of threat modelling, which caused minor delays. Experiencing this taught me the importance of early planning and structured documentation. Emotional responses such as stress during security testing motivated me to improve my technical competence and communication. Positive feedback from peers reinforced confidence in my leadership abilities.</p>
        <p>The project enabled me to link theory to practice. For example, ISO/IEC 27005 guided the development of a structured risk register. Applying Tuckman’s Team Development Model helped me understand team dynamics: we moved from “forming” to “performing” through clear roles and responsibilities. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle was evident in iterative testing: concrete experience (implementing features), reflective observation (post-testing review), abstract conceptualisation (linking to security theory), and active experimen
